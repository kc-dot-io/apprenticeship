# Class 2

### Generate a "github page" for your website
- Under the settings for your new repo I want you to use the "Automatic Page Generator" to generate a new website.
- This will generate a precoded site based on the design and options you choose. Pick something you like the look of.

### Pull changes to local
- Once you've generated this site you will be able to see it at username.github.com
- If you go back to your repo you should see a lot more files in it.
- Use git pull to download these files to your local repository

### Make a change to your website
- Inside the `_layouts` you should have a "default" layout.
- Open this default layout in vim
- Change the title
- Commit this change and send me a link to the commit on github
